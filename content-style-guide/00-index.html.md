title: Welcome to the Corgibytes Content Style Guide
layout: article
---

This style guide was created for Corgibytes employees. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Corgibytes.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

## Thanks, Mailchimp!

The nice folks at Mailchimp put a lot of time and energy into producing one of the best style guides out there, and then they open sourced it! We're grateful for their efforts and for sharing their work.
