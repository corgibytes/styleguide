One way we demonstrate our expertise is through technical content, which is typically written by subject matter experts. Technical content is an important part of our brand. It helps establish our credibility and is a big piece of our sales strategy.

## Guidelines

### Writing technical content

When writing technical content, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Stay relevant to the title

When a user clicks the title of an article, they expect to find the answer they want. Don’t stray too far from the title or topic at hand. Use links to make related content available. If you find you’re getting too far from the intended topic, then you may need to create a separate but related article.

### Keep headlines and paragraphs short and scannable

Focused users often scan an article for the part that will answer their particular question. Be sure headlines are short, descriptive, and parallel, to facilitate scanning.

### Strive for simplicity and clarity

Be as clear as possible. Use simple words and phrases, avoid gerunds and hard-to-translate idioms or words, focus on the specific task, limit the number of sentences per paragraph. If you must include edge cases or tangentially related information, set it aside in a Before You Start list or Notes field.

### Provide context through embedded screenshots and GIFs

Screenshots and GIFs may not be necessary for every article or process, but can be helpful to orient new users. Crop screenshots tightly around the action to focus attention.

## Editing technical content

We edit technical content based on three goals:

**Digestibility**

- Cut or tighten redundancies, gerunds, adverbs, and passive constructions.
- Use the simplest word.
- Limit paragraphs to three sentences.

**Consistency**

- Use the labels and terminology used in the Corgibytes app.
- Use specific, active verbs for certain tasks.
- Choose basic words and phrases to facilitate consistency across translated content.

**Helpfulness**

- Stay conversational, using contractions when appropriate.
- Avoid qualifiers that muddy meaning.
- Express understanding when appropriate.
- Craft clear transitions from section to section to orient the reader.

### Formatting technical content

Technical content uses organization, capitalization, and other formatting to help convey meaning. Although different articles are organized differently, some formatting tips are consistent throughout all technical content.

#### Headings

Group article content with H2s and H3s. Use H2s to organize content by higher-level topics or goals, and use H3s within each section to separate supporting information or tasks.

#### Ordered Lists

Only use ordered lists for step-by-step instructions. Separate steps into logical chunks, with no more than two related actions per step. When additional explanation or a screenshot is necessary, use a line break inside the list item.

#### Unordered Lists

Use unordered lists to display examples, or multiple notes in a Notes block. If an unordered list comprises more than 10 items, use a table instead.
