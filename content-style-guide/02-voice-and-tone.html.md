One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Corgibytes.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for Corgibytes. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

Corgibytes’s voice is human. It’s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. The world of software is incredibly confusing and complex. We set ourselves apart by making our content clear and helping our users get their work done so they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.

One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. Corgibytes’s voice is:

* Fun but not silly
* Confident but not cocky
* Smart but not stodgy
* Informal but not sloppy
* Helpful but not overbearing
* Expert but not bossy
* Precise but not pedantic

## Tone

Corgibytes’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they looking for help to a technical problem? Are they looking for a vendor to help them make their code easier to work with? Are they curious about our culture or technical philosophy? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

Corgibytes has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.

## A note about Ein

Ein is Corgibytes's mascot. Ein is a girl and uses she/her pronouns. Ein's name is one syllable and pronounced like the body part eye, with an n on the end. Not "in" or "Ian".

Scott used Ein as the inspiration for our name. She helped keep Scott and Andrea company in the early days of the company. She lived a long and happy life and passed away at the age of 16 in 2018. Scott wrote a [blog post](https://corgibytes.com/blog/2019/11/07/commemorating-ein/) commemorating her that you can read to get a sense of who she was.

Ein has been a part of Corgibytes since the company's beginning, and she captures the spirit of our brand’s personality. She has a "wrench bone" in her mouth, ready to help make the world's code better with a friendly, can-do attitude. Ein does not talk. Don't write in her voice.
