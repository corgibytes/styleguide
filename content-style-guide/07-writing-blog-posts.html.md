Corgibytes blog posts are written by people from all over the company, not just those with “writer” in their job titles. We love having people from around the office blog about their work. The person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it, and the writers on the marketing team can help with brainstorming and editing as needed.

## Basics

We update the main Corgibytes blog 1-2 times every week. We generally publish:

* Insights into our technical philosophy
* Technical deep-dives into interesting problems
* Examples of "mender" culture

We publish blog posts that explain the “why” behind the work we do at Corgibytes. We want to show people that we're an industry leader who is changing the way software is maintained and modernized. We use our blog to tell the stories behind what we do.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a Corgibytes user, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up
Feel free to link away from Corgibytes if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL
Corgibytes is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny .GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use Corgibytes, include screenshots to illustrate your point. When posting to WordPress, remove image links, or link the image to the relevant URL. Make sure to use alt text.
