The content at Corgibytes typically targets one of three core groups:
* Developers
* Technology Executives
* Product Influencers

When we're writing content, we want to make sure we're clear about who is going to be consuming it. Going deep on understanding our audience helps make sure that what we produce is likely to be useful, engaging, and worth sharing.


## Developers
Developers are people who spend most of their day working with code. Just like how there are introverts and extroverts in the world, we've discovered that there are different working styles among developers: Makers and Menders. These styles are similar to introverts and extroverts and it's better to think of them as a spectrum as opposed to a binary. Neither style is better than the other and some folks identify as both. 

### Menders
Menders are the most likely group to be super fans of Corgibytes. They see us as champions and an authoritative resource on working with legacy code. They are the target audience for Legacy Code Rocks and our hiring pool.

Only about 10% of developers self-identify as menders, so they're likely to feel undervalued and misunderstood. When they discover Corgibytes and the Legacy Code Rocks community, they often feel like they've found a tribe they've been searching for their entire career. Creating a sense of value and belonging is important when communicating with Menders.  

Menders derive satisfaction from giving new life to something that has been neglected and possibly on the verge of being abandoned. Menders tend to love to fix bugs, refactor, and maintain legacy code. The tiniest details matter with this group, so paying attention to small things really matters for our credibility.

##### Mender Challenges
* Finding camaraderie in a developer culture that's dominated by "Makers"
* Feel pressure by "the business" to ignore details and skip testing, which can be infuriating
* Little support to pursue the maintenance and improvements to existing code that they value
* Feeling different, misunderstood and frustrated
* Articulating the value of their work to makers or business-people
* Not often controlling budget or project scope

##### How Corgibytes Helps Menders
* Provide example of a corporate culture where menders can thrive
* Legacy Code Rocks community helps menders feel valued and connected
* Reminding menders that they are not alone, weird, or insignificant
* Recognizing shame and "othering" in development culture
* Emphasizing a sense of worth and belonging
* Sharing valuable tools and resources that will make their work easier
* Writing thought-leadership content that helps them "sell" the value of software modernization and maintenance to business-minded people within their organization

##### Characteristics
* Details, inconsistencies, and mistakes are the first things menders see — it's one of their superpowers
* Lean on logic more than intuition
* Educated - often computer science or coding certifications. Typically at least a college education
* Typically has worked in the industry for several years. They've learned what they enjoy working through their experience on a variety of projects.
* Working on teams of developers, usually in some kind of agile practice
* Thinks about how their work will make future development easier or more difficult
* Often smart, kind, introverted, sensitive, thoughtful and understated

##### Needs, Wants, Motivations
*   To be proud and feel valued for their craftsmanship
*   To improve the product, more so than to innovate
*   To be recognized as a valuable member of the team
*   To have the work of “mending” be recognized as necessary
*   To feel like they are doing things that have an big impact even though it is less obvious to some
*   To feel like they belong to a movement or at least that they are not alone
*   To work alongside peers with similar values
* Requires immense amounts of uninterrupted time to focus

### Makers
These developers are most excited by making something new. They tend to move fast and break things, focussing more on proof of concept than robust, future-proof builds. They will usually avoid maintenance and bug fix tasks in favor of working up new features and exploring new concepts. Typically, they will be comfortable accruing technical debt as they move quickly to roll out the next iteration.

Makers can be a great opportunity for Corgibytes. We speak their language and could easily connect with them as a useful resource. Building trust with maker devs and positioning ourselves as a helpful resource that will take on the tasks they aren’t interested in, can lead makers to advocating on our behalf to their CTOs and CEOs.

Makers are also the source demographic for the menders that are the target audience for Legacy Code Rocks.

##### Challenges
*   Testing code
*   Maintenance and refactoring
*   Unwieldy amounts of technical debt
*   Bugfixes


##### Corgibytes Solutions
*   We’ll do what they don’t want to or don’t feel comfortable doing
*   Keep morale high, letting makers focus on the work they want to do
*   As menders, we are the perfect complement to makers because we speak the same language, but view bugs and maintenance as a way to bring value to a product and refactoring for optimization.
*   As menders, we are the perfect work partners for makers because we both enjoy working on improving a product, but from different angles.
*   As makers come up with new features, we—as menders—will find flaws and suggest efficiencies.


##### Demographics
*   Very technically proficient and oriented.
*   Educated - often computer science or coding certifications. Typically at least a college education.
*   Working on teams of developers, usually in some kind of agile practice.
*   Often working on-site in more corporate environments and more and more are working remotely, especially for mid-size and startups
*   Full-time employees are more likely for the larger organizations with bigger software needs
*   Freelancers and contractors often supplement in-house teams.
*   Mid-size organizations or larger ones with moderate needs might outsource the bulk of this work to a third party agency. This means there is an opportunity to make connections through agency partners across client networks
*   Mostly males. Overwhelmingly so compared to some other professions. Often white or of indian or asian backgrounds. But, diversity in this industry is growing. Just look at Corgibytes!


##### Needs, wants, motivations
*   To improve the product
*   To be recognized as a valuable member of the team
*   To feel like they are doing things that have an obvious big impact
*   To feel like they are innovating
*   To feel like they are free to focus on the tasks that excite them
*   To enjoy their work
*   To feel they are doing things the “right” way—whatever that might be perceived to be. This may be more of a factor with menders, but developer culture has a strong emphasis on doing things the “right way,” even though that way is often in debate. For makers this is probably more often either what they know or what is new. This motivation is a big factor in any interaction with developers in general. Being sensitive to the way things are being done will be important in building trust. If you need to suggest an alternate approach, take care to be respectful of the previous approach and its standard bearers.
*   To avoid tedium, relatively speaking




## Technology Executives
*   The decision makers with the influence to bring Corgibytes in
*   The high level perspective to see the value of addressing technical debt


### Chief Technical Officer (CTO)

These individuals often have the authority to bring Corgibytes into a project or relationship. As they are the top level managers of the development team, they are also likely to notice slowdowns in development progress due to a build up of bugs and poorly maintained code.



*   Good understanding of technical debt
*   Probably not aware companies like Corgibytes exist
*   Would likely respond to the business value of Corgibytes’ services
*   More familiar with coding than most leadership, but probably not as familiar or responsive to technical jargon and concepts as a full time developer


##### Challenges:



*   Concerns about team efficiency
*   Developers might be avoiding or bogged down by bugfixes
*   Slowdowns in development progress due to their development team being disinterested in or not skilled enough to improve their application as it matures past initial launch and core features


##### Corgibytes Solutions



*   Modernize and maintain existing software
*   Complement or support existing development team by taking on bugfixes, maintenance and refactoring tasks, allowing “maker” devs to focus on new features
*   Ultimately improve efficiency and speed of the development team


##### Demographics



*   Usually a background in development or engineering
*   Average age: 56. Skews older for larger companies
*   Mostly white male, but more female than CEOs. Notably higher percentage of Indian and Indian-American.


##### Needs, wants, motivations



*   To create and innovate
*   To support their team
*   To source and maintain technical solutions that benefit the company


### Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

Mostly focused on the most high level progress, this role is likely to respond well to the business value of Corgibytes’ services. We need to focus the website on targeting this audience group more.



*   Concerns about the bottom line
*   Attendant to the company’s culture
*   Striving to always be moving the company forward
*   Might not grasp the concept of technical debt
*   Likely doesn’t relate to dev-speak and technical jargon
*   Think technology will be the most important external force shaping the future of their enterprises (according to _The Customer-activated Enterprise, Insights from the Global C-suite Study _by IBM Institute for Business Value)


##### Challenges:



*   Maintaining an “innovative” and hip culture that is probably more geared to attracting makers than menders
*   Frustration and slowed progress amidst the development team
*   Missing development milestones leads to disrupting growth and bottom line
*   Might need to hire or transition a CTO
*   Another aspect might be that while everyone is working with the right motivations, mistakes can happen that may lead CEOs to be locked out of their own databases, etc. Need to be wary of infamous unknown unknowns. Brian wrote a great post about this: [http://corgibytes.com/blog/2017/03/02/dude-where-is-my-code/](http://corgibytes.com/blog/2017/03/02/dude-where-is-my-code/)

### Private Equity

Experienced investors understand the pitfalls of not addressing technical debt—or at least the outcomes. They can encourage assets to invest in modernization and maintenance of software and systems.



*   Concerns about the bottom line
*   Strong outlook for the future and often a lot of experience to draw on being involved in other companies’ development
*   Might require and even ask for a lot of education on the concept of technical debt
*   Likely doesn’t relate to dev-speak and technical jargon
*   Want to get things done and more holistically focused on long term health and success, past the next milestone


##### Challenges:



*   Growth of an investment can be bogged down by technical debt


##### Corgibytes Solutions



*   Modernize and maintain existing software
*   Directly address technical debt


##### Demographics



*   Usually quite experienced running an organization and often experienced guiding organizations to success
*   Don’t typically have coding experience


##### Needs, wants, motivations



*   To guide the startup or organization to success
*   To remove stumbling blocks in the path of a growing company
*   To increase the value of the company and its assets


### Founders

In particular, founders that are transitioning or have transitioned out of the CEO role. This is a good indication the company is growing past the startup phase.



*   If it’s a tech company, the founders might be well versed in coding and still as connected to development as much as a CTO would be. Also, the codebase might have areas that are very dependant on the founder as they may have been the original developer.
*   Tend to have a strong Maker gene that can make them flippant or even skeptical about the need to address technical debt


##### Challenges:



*   - As the founder extracts from operations, delegation of tasks and responsibilities can be problematic. Hiring or promoting to keep up what the founder was doing.
*   How to safeguard against loss of understanding of the codebase as founder transitions away from day-to-day interaction with it
*   Maintain the presence of expertise around critical software
*   Transfer familiarity of working with the codebase. Transitioning it to a state that can be collaborated on.


##### Corgibytes Solutions



*   - Safeguarding the codebase from dysfunction
*   Providing the expertise to keep the codebase functional and workable - potentially transitioning to a state that internal developers can better work with


##### Demographics



*   Such a wide range of backgrounds. Just as often not a business or tech focused education.
*   In particular, Corgibytes is targeting founders that have been acting as CEO, but have grown the company enough to consider transitioning out of that role. Often, founders aren’t the best fit for the CEO role of a growing company and there are more effective ways for them to contribute and maintain the company’s vision.


##### Needs, wants, motivations



*   Wants to know that productivity of their dev team won’t decline as they transition their role
*   Want to have someone with expertise to be accountable for the codebase continuing to function and be manageable
*   Looking for reassurance that they can focus their attention elsewhere and the codebase/software will not fall apart


## Product Influencers

Other roles surrounding the software and product development process can be persuasive advocates of Corgibytes’ services. Though they might not be in a coding role themselves, these individual have insight into the workings and health of the development team and often feel responsibility for their success. These individuals tend to lean towards makers themselves, though they might not be coders.

Product influencers are in a management position that gives them sway and authority to help get Corgibytes hired.


### Product Owners & UX designers

Heavily involved in the iteration and improvement of the company’s software, these roles can understand tech value. Product owners, similar to CTO’s, are responsive to slowdowns in the development team’s performance and efficiency. UX designers inherently understand the idea of constant improvement through iteration and testing.


##### Challenges



*   Concerns about team efficiency as they impact the development of the product
*   Developers might be avoiding or bogged down by bugfixes
*   Slowdowns in development progress due to their development team being disinterested in or not skilled enough to improve their application as it matures past initial launch and core features
*   Poorly maintained software usually yields a problematic user experience
*   Having to design around roadblocks from poorly functioning code


##### Corgibytes Solutions



*   Modernize and maintain existing software
*   Complement or support existing development team by taking on bugfixes, maintenance and refactoring tasks, allowing “maker” devs to focus on new features
*   Ultimately improve efficiency and speed of the development team
*   Remove roadblocks in code, opening up potential for improvements and iteration


##### Demographics



*   These individuals may not have direct interaction with code, but they usually are collaborating directly with developers on their team or downstream in the process.
*   In the case of Product Owners, they may be helping manage a team of developers.


##### Needs, wants, motivations



*   To improve the user’s experience with the product/software
*   To better align the outcome of the software with the organizational objectives


### Tech Coaches and Project managers

Agile coaches, tech coaches and project managers often have a front row seat to the symptoms and negative effects of an unwieldy amount of technical debt. Being involved in the health of the development team and the health of development projects would motivate them to see the value in Corgibytes’ services.


##### Challenges



*   Dysfunction within the development team—avoidance of bug fixing tasks, groanings around maintenance and complexity of the codebase
*   Overwhelming volume of bugs
*   Slowdowns in development progress
*   Amount of effort per task is increasing
*   Lack of enthusiasm in scrum meetings, lack of volunteers for certain tasks


##### Corgibytes Solutions



*   Modernize and maintain existing software
*   Complement or support existing development team by taking on bugfixes, maintenance and refactoring tasks, allowing “maker” devs to focus on new features
*   Ultimately improve efficiency and speed of the development team


##### Demographics



*   Obviously a strong background in project management and Agile development.
*   They may have certifications or just a lot of experience coaching teams.
*   Often these individuals operate as consultants, brought in when there is a transition or particular need. Particularly the coaches.
*   Project managers covers a wide range of roles and formats. Are more likely to be full time employees than freelancers. They might have a looser relationship to Agile and Extreme development than an agile coach. This might include Scrum Masters
*   Agile tech coaches are considered expert Software Craftspersons, focused on the engineering practices of the team.
*   Agile process coaches are focused on improving the flow of how the team works.
